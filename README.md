My name is Julien 'Azthenor' Dere, 
I have been a front-end web developer for a year, and worked mainly as a freelance for different projects. 

By browsing this repo, you can find the projects I have worked on, mainly alone, and have a look at what I can do. 

My first github account was a complete mess so do not mind the "dates" on some commits or linked repos, as I have added them sometimes long after I finished the project.

This one is made to be clearer and serve as book/portfolio for done, ongoing and future projects.

Cheers !
